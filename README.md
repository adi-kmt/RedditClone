- Simple [basic functions with well-supported conditional expressions](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DSL#basic-crud-operations)
- Intuitive way to interact between tables using [joins](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DSL#join)
- Easy to combine multiple requirements over a single (SQL query Sample from
